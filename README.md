# RustBridge

RustBridge is a new project being developed by the [Rust Language Community Team](https://github.com/rust-community)
to make the [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org) more accessible to people who are underrepresented in technology.
It is being developed in partnership with the [BridgeFoundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/).

This project is in its very early stages, so if you would like to participate, please first start by either opening
or commenting on [RustBridge issues](https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge/issues), starting a conversation
in [users.rust-lang.org/c/community](https://users.rust-lang.org/c/community), or joining us on
[#rustbridge](https://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rustbridge).

Early visitors can [have a look at workshop materials](workshops.md) currently being developed.
