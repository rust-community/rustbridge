![experiment](img/experiment.jpg)

???

* This curriculum is an experiment. It's mildly disorganized and semi-tested.
* Please take notes about what you liked, didn't like, wished we spent more or less time on, etc -- there will be a survey!

---
class: middle, left

## Overview

* What and why Rust?
* Rustup, Cargo, Setup
* Syntax + Concepts mostly the same as other languages
* Syntax + Concepts particular to Rust
* Further learning

???

* So anyway, lets get started. Here is our agenda.

---
class: middle, center

![firefox](img/firefox-512-noshadow.png)

???

* Rust came out of Mozilla Research
* 300 Million users
* Written in C++
* Mozilla decided that C++ was fundamentally unsafe.

## Read after free

```c
Audio* audio = new Audio("sound.wav");

...

delete audio;

...

play(audio);
```

???

* Classic bug is called use-after-free.
* Addressed by garbage collection
* Problem with GC is performance

## Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly **fast**, **prevents segfaults**, and guarantees **thread safety**

???

* Ask class to define "systems programming", what do they think of when they hear it
* Fast = as fast as C
* segfaults = crashing because of mismanaged memory
* Memory safety also covers buffer over/underflows

---
class: middle, left

## What is Systems Programming?

* Programming without a Garbage Collector
* Operating Systems, Databases, Games
* Close to the Metal
* Pay-as-you-go, lightweight runtime, or no runtime

???

* Systems programming can mean many things to many people.
* One of the primary
* One way of thinking about it is programm

---
class: middle, left

## That doesn't to mean

* You need to be an expert programmer
* Pointers, malloc, and free
* Targeting Unix-only or Windows-only
* Old school tools like hand-crafted Makefiles

???

* Writing your entire language in a systems language

---
class: middle, left

## Rust Philosophy

* Favor explicit over implicit
* Zero-cost abstractions
* Only pay for what you use
* Memory safety
* Small standard library
* Error handling
* Stability without stagnation

???

* This does make it harder to prototype in Rust sometimes

- A new version comes out every 6 weeks
- Stability without stagnation
- your stuff won't break
- channels
- cool new stuff is still being added!
- experimental stuff starts nightly only

---

## Setting up Rust with Rustup and Cargo

---
class: middle, left

## What is Rustup?

Rustup is the official Rust toolchain installer, and makes it easy to keep Rust up to date.
It supports all Rust platforms, including Windows.

1. `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
2. `rustup install stable`

If that did not work, try:

1. `source ~/.cargo/env`
2. `rustup install stable`

Or you can use one of the builtin installers:

https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/other-installers.html

---
class: middle, left

## What is Cargo?

* Package manager
* Build tool
* Test runner
* Documentation generator
* Package publisher

???

* A lot of these things are convenience wrappers around other tools like rustc
and rustdoc.

---
class: middle, left

## Setting up a Project

We're going to be making a *binary* project; the other option is a *library*.

`cargo new` will create a skeleton project setup for you.

1. `cd` to a directory where you like to store code
2. `cargo new --bin rustbridge`
3. `cd rustbridge`

If you use version control, now would be a good time to commit.

???

If you are writing a <strong>library</strong>, it means you intend for your
code to be used in someone else's application as a crate or module.

If you are writing a <strong>binary</strong>, it means that you'd like
to write code that compiles into a binary that someone can run. If you
want to do this, you need to use a `main.rs`. Inside the `main.rs` you
should have a `main` function.

---
class: middle, left

## Files created

- `Cargo.toml`: metadata about your project and its dependencies
- `.gitignore`: ignores compiled files built by Rust
- `src/main.rs`: where your Rust code goes

---
class: middle, left

## `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[package]
name = "rustbridge"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Carol (Nichols || Goulding) <carol.nichols@gmail.com>"]

[dependencies]
```

???

* Cargo got your name from your env, probably from git.
* If it's not there, or if it's wrong, go ahead and fix it.

---
class: middle, left

## `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

???

* `fn` starts a function definition
* `main` is the name of the function
* `main` fn is special - entry point of your binary
* curly braces around the body
* `println!` is a macro (don't worry) that prints to the screen
* End lines with semicolons (mostly, we'll talk later)

---
class: middle, left

## Run it!

* `cargo run`
* Should print "Hello, world!"
* Now you have more files:
  * `target` directory: all the built stuff
  * `Cargo.lock`: locks your dependencies (we don't have any yet)
* Try printing out something else!
* Try printing out two things!

---
class: middle, left

## API Documentation

https://doc.rust-lang.org/
or
`rustup doc`

Click on "Standard Library API Reference"
or
`rustup doc --std`

---
class: middle, center

## Syntax + Concepts mostly the same as other languages

---
class: middle, left

## Comments

* Double slash at the beginning of a line (`//`)
* Block quotes with `/*` and `*/`
* Try commenting out one of your lines printing!
* There are other kinds of comments but this is the most common

---
class: middle, left

## Variables

```rust
let name = "ashley";
let age = 30;
println!("Hi, {}! You are {} years old.", name, age);
```

Try making more variables and printing them all out in one `println!`

???

* `let`, variable name, single equals, value, semicolon.
* Crab pincers in println, then values that should fit in there

---
class: left

## Experiment

What happens if you run this:

```rust
let apples = 100;
apples += 50;
println!("I have {} apples", apples);
```

???

* Have someone read the error message
* Whenever anyone gets an error message, we'll read it out loud and talk about it so everyone can learn!

--

```
error[E0384]: re-assignment of immutable variable `apples`
 --> src/main.rs:3:5
  |
2 |     let apples = 100;
  |         ------ first assignment to `apples`
3 |     apples += 50;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ re-assignment of immutable variable
```

---
class: middle, left

## Mutability

Variables are *immutable* by default in Rust.

```rust
let mut apples = 100;
apples += 50;
println!("I have {} apples", apples);
```

???

* Rust has functional influences
* Changing a value where you didn't expect to is a common source of bugs.

---
class: middle, left

## Types

Rust is strongly, statically typed. Common fundamental types are:

- `u32`: unsigned 32-bit integer
- `i32`: signed 32-bit integer
- `f64`: floating point number
- `String` and/or `&str`: more on these later
- `bool`: a boolean

---
class: middle, left

## Type inference

* Every value has a type that the compiler has to know about.
* Most of the time, the compiler can figure it out.
* Sometimes it can't, and you'll get an error and need to add an annotation.
* We could have written `let age: i32 = 30;`
* A place we **must** specify types is function definitions.

???

* Types come after the name

---
class: middle, left

## Functions

```rust
fn add_fifty(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n + 50
}

fn main() {
    println!("Lots: {}", add_fifty(100));
}
```

???

* Argument/parameter, named with type specified
* `->` plus return type, if returning a value
* No semicolon on the last line when returning that value
* No `return` keyword unless doing an early return
* Function call always uses parens, even if no arguments

---
class: middle, left

## Conditionals: `if`

```rust
fn main() {
    let age = 13u32;
    if n < 13 {
        println!("You may see G or PG movies");
    } else if n < 17 {
        println!("You may see G, PG, or PG-13 movies");
    } else {
        println!("You are old.");
        println!("You may see G, PG, PG-13, or R movies");
    }
}
```

???

* Shorthand for numeric type annotation
* Age can't be negative, compiler will make sure we don't have negative ages

---
class: middle, left

## Conditionals: `match`

Kinda like a switch. But better.

```rust
fn main() {
    let age = 13u32;
    match age {
        0...12 => println!("You may see G or PG movies"),
        13...16 => println!("You may see G, PG, or PG-13 movies"),
        _ => {
            println!("You are old.");
            println!("You may see G, PG, PG-13, or R movies")
        },
    }
}
```

???

* Underscore is catch-all
* Pattern, rocket, code to run
* Commas at the end of the code to run
* If the code is more than one line, surround with curly braces
* Trailing comma on the last one is the style
* What if we take out the line with the underscore? This is advantage to `match` over `if`/`else if`/`else`

---
class: middle, left

## Arrays

Kinda like arrays in other languages.

```rust
let mut color = [255, 0, 255];
color[0] = 100;
println!("The color is {:?}", color);
```

???

* Arrays are a fixed size known at compile time
* Square brackets, commas
* Indexing to a particular location
* Need debug formatting in println since Rust doesn't know how you want to display arrays to your users

---
class: middle, left

## Quick but Useful Tangent #1: `println!` formatting

* `{}` is called `Display` formatting; only on primitive types by default
* `{:?}` is called `Debug` formatting; more types have this by default
* Display is for end users, Debug is for... debugging
* Rust doesn't want to make assumptions
* My favorite: `{:#?}` = pretty debug
* [`fmt` docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fmt/index.html)

---
class: middle, left

## Quick but Useful Tangent #2: `panic!`

* Panic stops your program with a message.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("aaaaa!");
}
```

What happens in the last example if we try to access an element out of bounds of the array?

```rust
let color = [255, 0, 255];
let index = 9;
println!("The 10th element is {:?}", color[index]);
```

???

* It's a `panic!` behind the scenes!
* This has to do with safety-- don't continue with bad data!

---
class: middle, left

## Vectors

Most of the time, you probably want a vector rather than array.

```rust
let mut prices = vec![30, 100, 2];
prices[0] = 25;
prices.push(40);
println!("All the prices are: {:?}", prices);
```

???

* `vec!` shorthand macro, the rest is like an array
* Vecs can change in size at runtime
* So we can call the `push` method

---
class: middle, left

## Looping (and ranges)

* `for` loops are most common:

```rust
for i in 0..10 {
    println!("Number {}", i);
}
```

```rust
let names = vec!["Carol", "Jake", "Marylou", "Bruce"];
for name in names.iter() {
    println!("Hi {}!", name);
}
```

* `loop` creates an infinite loop
* `while` loops run while their condition is true
* `break` exits the current loop

???

* `for` loop means you never go past the end of the array

---
class: middle, left

## Iterators

```rust
for i in (0..10).filter(|x| x % 2 == 0) {
    println!("i = {}", i);
}

for i in (0..10).map(|x| x * x ) {
    println!("i = {}", i);
}

let sum = (0..10).fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x);
println!("sum = {}", sum);
```

* See the [Iterator docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) for lots more fun stuff.
* The `|x| x % 2 == 0` in the examples is a closure, they can be used in other situations too.

---
class: middle, left

## Enums

* Nice to use with `match`

```rust
enum TrafficLight {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}
let light = TrafficLight::Green;

match light {
    TrafficLight::Red => println!("STOP!"),
    TrafficLight::Yellow => println!("Slow down!"),
    TrafficLight::Green => println!("Go go go!"),
}
```

???

* Double colon is namespacing
* Show warnings!

---
class: middle, left

## Enums

* Better than in other languages: can hold values!

```rust
enum GameType {
    SinglePlayer,
    MultiPlayer(u32),
}

let game = GameType::MultiPlayer(4);

match game {
    GameType::SinglePlayer => println!("How about solitaire?"),
    GameType::MultiPlayer(2) => println!("How about checkers?"),
    GameType::MultiPlayer(4) => println!("How about bridge?"),
    GameType::MultiPlayer(num) => {
        println!("How about {}-player tag?", num)
    },
}
```

???

* Values are specific to each variant
* Have to define the type of the values in the variant
* Destructure = patterns that bind to parts
* Destructure to get values out

---
class: middle, center

## Syntax + Concepts particular to Rust

---
class: middle, left

## Option

**Rust doesn't have `nil`/`null`** so to express that a value might be something or nothing, Rust has the `Option` type.

Option is an enum provided by the standard library:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

???

* T is a generic type parameter, means Some can hold any type
* No more undefined method on nil!!!!

---
class: middle, left

## Using Option

```rust
let mut instructors = vec!["Carol"];

let a = instructors.pop();
println!("a is {:?}", a);

let b = instructors.pop();
println!("b is {:?}", b);
```

???

* When we pop off the last element of a vec, there might not be one!

---
class: middle, left

## Using Option

```rust
let a = Some("Carol");

let name = a.expect("A value is present");
println!("Name is {} bytes long", name.len());
```

???

* Can't call `len` on an `Option` directly since it could be `None`!
* expect panics if it gets a None, good for prototyping or when you're REALLY REALLY SURE you have Some
    * Set an error message in expect that is useful to you for debugging
    * Try changing `a` to this and see what happens
        `let a: Option<&str> = None;`
    * Mention but gloss over type annotation

---
class: middle, left

## Using Option

```rust
let b: Option<&str> = None;

match b {
    Some(name) => {
        println!("Other name is {} bytes long", name.len())
    },
    None => {
        println!("No name!")
    }
}
```

???

* Match is useful for handling both cases
* Option is just another enum!

---
class: middle, left

## Result

* Another enum in the standard library
* For when something could succeed or fail
* Rust doesn't have exceptions; using `Result` is how you handle errors.

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

???

---
class: middle, left

## Using Result

```rust
let numstr = "6";
let num = numstr.parse::<i32>();
println!("num = {:?}", num);

let numstr = "florp";
let num = numstr.parse::<i32>();
println!("num = {:?}", num);
```

???

* Turbofish! Because we could parse into many different types.

---
class: middle, left

## Using Result

```rust
let numstr = "6";
let num = numstr.parse::<i32>();
let num = num.expect("should have a number");

println!("num + 5 = {}", num + 5);
```

---
class: middle, left

## Using Result

```rust
let numstr = "florp";
let num = numstr.parse::<i32>();

let answer = match num {
    Ok(n) => n + 5,
    Err(_) => 0,
};
println!("Answer is {}", answer);
```

???

* Yes, this might feel annoying to be forced to think about failure cases all the time
* But it will save debugging time later, trust me
* There are lots of methods on Option and Result to help with common ways of handling them

---
class: middle, left

## `?` to propagate errors up

Can only be used in methods/functions that return `Result`!!!!

```rust
fn add_five_to_string(s: String) ->
    Result<i32, std::num::ParseIntError> {

    let ans = s.parse::<i32>()? + 5;
    Ok(ans)
}
```

???

* Typical to have lots of functions that return `Result` then have a `match` at the outer layer
* Unstable `?` operator coming soon to make this even nicer and chainable

---
class: middle, left

## Strings: WARNING

* Strings in Rust feel complicated
* We're sorry

???

Working with strings in Rust is more complicated than working with strings in other languages.

Strings are actually complicated in all languages, it's just that most hide the complexity from you and make choices for you. Rust makes you be explicit with the choices.

---
class: middle, left

## Two string types

### `String`

* Allocated
* Growable
* Can create with either:
  * `something.to_string()`
  * `String::from("string slice")`

### `&str`

* Pronounced "string slice"
* View into string data stored somewhere else
* Hardcoded strings are `&str`s

???

* `String` is kinda like `Vec`

---
class: middle, left

## A common problem

```rust
fn fizz(num: u32) -> String {
    if num % 3 == 0 {
        "Fizz"
    } else {
        num.to_string()
    }
}
```

???

* "Fizz" here isn't a String, it's a &str
* Have to make Fizz a String to fix this

---
class: middle, left

## A common problem

```rust
fn fizz(num: u32) -> String {
    if num % 3 == 0 {
        "Fizz".to_string()  // <-- convert "Fizz" into a string
    } else {
        num.to_string()
    }
}
```

---
class: middle, left

## Slices

* A view into some data
* Points to the start of the view
* Knows how long the view is

---
class: middle, left

## Slice syntax

* Vector type: `Vec<i32>`
* Corresponding slice type: `&[i32]`

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let piece = &v[3..];
println!("piece of v = {:?}", piece);
```

???

* For any type of thing you put in a vector
* Range syntax

---
class: middle, left

## String Slices

```rust
let s = String::from("Call me Ishmael blah blah...");
let part = &s[0..4];

println!("part is '{}'", part);
```

???

* Vec<T> : &[T] :: String : &str
* With string slices, indices are bytes, not chars, long story

* All kinds of slices are useful because they let you share data without copying all of it around

---
class: middle, left

## Ownership

* The *owner* of a resource is who is responsible for cleaning it up.
* When owners go out of scope, Rust automatically calls the cleanup code.

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("v is valid here! {:?}", v);
}
```

???

* Point to where s is valid and where s goes out of scope

---
class: middle, left

## Transferring Ownership

* When you pass an argument to a function, ownership is transferred to the function.
* We say that something is *moved*.

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    print_vec(v);
    print_vec(v);
}

fn print_vec(v: Vec<i32>) {
    println!("v is {:?}", v);
}
```

???

* Explain error message
* Yes this is weird and annoying!
* Don't worry we'll fix it!

---
class: middle, left

## References

* Let you borrow a resource you don't own
* A reference is only valid as long as the owner is valid. Rust ensures you aren't using an invalid reference *at compile time*.
* Slices are a specific type of reference.

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    print_vec(&v[..]);
    print_vec(&v[..]);
}

fn print_vec(v: &[i32]) {
    println!("v is {:?}", v);
}
```

???

- So unless you *want* your function to take ownership of an argument, you *probably* will have most of your functions take references as arguments.

---
class: middle, left

## Mutable References

* Like variables, references are immutable by default, but you can make them mutable with `mut`.
* You may have many immutable references in a scope
* You may only have one mutable reference and no immutable references in a scope

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    change_vec(&mut v[..]);
    change_vec(&mut v[..]);
    println!("v is {:?}", v);
}

fn change_vec(v: &mut [i32]) {
    v[0] *= 5;
}
```

???

* This is how you would make a function that's allowed to change its arguments.

---
class: middle, left

## Not allowed to have mutable and immutable references in the same scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let f = &v[0];
    v.clear();

    println!("What would f be? {}", f);
}
```

???

* This won't compile-- look at the error.
* Where is the immutable reference?
* Where is the mutable reference?
* Other languages will let you do this and give you invalid data.
* Security vulnerabilities!

---
class: middle, left

## Further learning
### Syntax + Concepts we didn't cover but that are things

.pull-left[
* Tests
* Lifetimes
* Tuples
* Structs
* Methods
* `if let`
]
.pull-right[
* FFI
* Traits
* Generics
* Macros
* Threads
* Composition over inheritance
]

---
class: middle, left

## Just One More Thing: Crates

![cratesio](img/cratesio.png)

???

* Like rubygems.org
* Easy to add crates to your project
* Rust's stdlib is small and stable
* Crates can change more rapidly and more radically independently of Rust
* We're going to be using some crates for our project!
